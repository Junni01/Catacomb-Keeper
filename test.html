`<p>When the heroes arrive at Izchak the Merchant during
the Exploration Phase, they may use their gold to buy
items to aid them in their quest. The Overseer shuffles the
deck of Item cards and flips over six cards for the players
to examine. These items are available for purchase or the
players can pay two gold coins to see the next card on
the top of the Item card deck. There is no limit as to how
many times they may do this. Any player can purchase any
number of the revealed Item cards provided they meet the
requirements. Players may pool their gold coins to assist in
the purchase of items. When an item has been purchased,
the gold coins are returned to the Treasury. The Item card
is assigned to the hero by placing it in the designated area
on the heroâ€™s player mat.
As an additional service, a map may be purchased from
the Merchant by any hero for two gold coins. When the
map is paid for, all
the Room cards
in the catacomb
are flipped over,
thus revealing the
path leading to the
Catacomb Lord.</p>`
